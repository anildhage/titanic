## Overview 

 	As you may know Titanic dataset has been the most used begginer friendly project that one can do to become a data science analyst. I have done this after learning how data is understood, gathered, processed and later on used for model building. 

 	About this dataset, we find information about the passengers who survived and who didn't. We are given a task to build a model that would predict our target feature which is the 'Survived' column based upon some independent features. 

 	But before we get on to the model building, we need to clean the dataset.

 	All the process is done in the link provided above with comments to help you understand it
